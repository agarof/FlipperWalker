# FlipperWalker

This is an external module for the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/)
meant to enable it to emulate a
[PokeWalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_DS_accessories#Pok%C3%A9walker).

The external module is designed using [KiCad](https://kicad.org). It includes an
accelerometer IC capable of counting steps while consuming very little power as
well as an IR transceiver supporting the IrDA's SIR standard at 115.2kbit/s.
